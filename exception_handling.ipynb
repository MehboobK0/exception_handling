    "Q1. An Exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. The difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors is that Syntax errors occur when there is a grammatical error in the code, whereas Exceptions occur during the execution of the code due to unexpected conditions or events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. When an exception is not handled, it propagates up the call stack until it reaches the top-level of the program, which may lead to program termination. For example, if a division by zero exception is not handled, it will cause the program to terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. In Python, the try, except, finally, and else statements are used to catch and handle exceptions. The try block contains the code that may raise an exception, the except block catches and handles the exception, the finally block contains cleanup code that should be executed regardless of whether an exception occurs, and the else block contains code that should be executed if no exception occurs."
